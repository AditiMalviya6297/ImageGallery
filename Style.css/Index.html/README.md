# Responsive Image Gallery

This is a simple responsive image gallery demo with:

- CSS grid responsive layout
- Hover effects and smooth transitions
- Lightbox with next/prev and keyboard navigation
- Category filters (All / Nature / City / Animals)
- Bonus: image filter CSS classes available in `gallery.css`

How to view
1. Open `Gallery.html` in a browser (double-click or via Live Server).
2. Click any image to open the lightbox. Use arrow keys or buttons to navigate.
3. Use the filter buttons to show specific categories.

Files
- `Gallery.html` - main page (already present)
- `gallery.css` - styles
- `gallery.js` - javascript behavior

Notes
- Replace `*.jpg` image file names in `Gallery.html` with real images or keep as placeholders.
- The project is standalone; no build step required.
