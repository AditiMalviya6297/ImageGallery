# ImageGallery
This project is a responsive image gallery built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to browse images by category—Nature, City, and Animals—using simple filter buttons. The gallery features a lightbox view with navigation controls to view images in a larger format and supports lazy loading for optimized performance.
